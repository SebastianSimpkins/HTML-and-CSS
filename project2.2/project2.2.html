      <h1 class='header'>My Hobbies</h1>
      <br/>
      <p class='content'>I have many hobbies, all of them are outdoors.  Because
        of this, it is not always possible to do them as much as I would like.
        I love to go scuba diving and try to go at least once every summer, if I
        can, I will also fit in some sailing.  I also love the mountains and try
        to go skiing, hiking and climbing as much as possible. However I do not
        have an addictive personality and like to try out new things as much as
        I can.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='who'>
      <h1 class='header'>Who am I?</h1>
      <br/>
      <p class='content'>If I had to describe myself in a few words I would say
        I am a very open minded person who looks at the world from a different
        angle and who often questions the status quo.  I had a very good chance
        to observe the world through my many adventures which bought me all
        around the world.  I have been very lucky since I got to travel to many
        different places while being so young.  Since the first euro I made I
        put all my earning and savings into travel and explorations which led me
        to visit around 27 countries before my 21st birthday.
        I speak English, Italian and a little bit of Spanish.  I was born in
        Italy but my nationality is British.  I am 21 years old, young but
        thirsty to learn and improve to be the best I can be.</p>

      <div class='future'>
      <h1 class='header'>My Future</h1>
      <br/>
      <p class='content'>I have many plans for my future and I wish to realise
        them all! I am currently working on becoming a React Native developer
        through a startup called Start2Impact.  Within three months I will be
        fluent enough to work with html, css, javascript, react and react native.
        I wish to work for a good company who can see and use my potential and
        give me the opportunity to show them what I have to offer.  There are
        two reasons why I want to work in this field, the first is that I have
        a passion for it and I think it is a great way to express your
        creativity through something useful, secondly because it goes very well
        with my passion for travelling as it is possible to follow this line of
        work remotely.</p>
